    //Aspect in Spring is a class that addresses your cross-cutting concerns.

    //Advice --> Before, After, Around
    //Itâ€™s the behavior that addresses system-wide concerns (logging, security checks, etc).
    //This behavior is represented by a method to be executed at a JoinPoint. This behavior can be executed
    //Before, After, or Around the JoinPoint according to the Advice type.


    //Pointcut expression
    //1 initial star * is for return type of the method we say it can be any
    //2 then we specify the fully qualified name of the class.* means any method of that class for any argument (..)
    //A Pointcut is an expression that defines at what JoinPoints a given Advice should be applied.


    //JoinPoint is the place (method) where your business logic is implemented
    //JoinPoint is a point in the execution flow of a method where an Aspect can be plugged in.
